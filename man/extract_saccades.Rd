\title{Extract saccades from samples using votes from selected methods.}
\usage{
extract_saccades(
  x,
  y,
  sample_rate,
  trial = NULL,
  methods = list("ek", "om", "nh"),
  options = NULL,
  velocity_time_window = 20,
  binocular = "merge",
  vote_threshold = ifelse(length(methods) == 1, 1, ((length(methods) -
    1)/length(methods)) * 0.99),
  minimal_duration_ms = 12,
  minimal_separation_ms = 12,
  return_votes = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Horizontal coordinate, either a vector for monocular data or a two-column matrix for binocular data.}

\item{y}{Vertical coordinate, either a vector for monocular data or a two-column matrix for binocular data.}

\item{sample_rate}{Sampling rate in Hz. It is assumed to be common for the entire time series.
If the time series contains chunks (trials) that were recorded using different acquisition rate
(e.g., SR Research Eyelink allows to set different acquisition rate for each recording / trial),
you would need to split the time series and analyze them separately.}

\item{trial}{Optional vector with trial ID. If omitted, all samples are assumed to belong to a single trial.
Velocity, acceleration, and saccades themselves are computed respecting trial borders.}

\item{methods}{A \emph{list} (not a vector!) with names of package methods (character) or external functions that
implement sample classification (see \emph{Using Custom Methods} vignette). Package methods include
Engbret & Kliegl (2003) (\code{"ek"}), Otero-Millan et al. (\code{"om"}), Nyström and Holmqvist (2010) (\code{"nh"}).}

\item{options}{A named list with options for a specific method, see documentation on specific method for details.}

\item{velocity_time_window}{Time window for computing velocity and acceleration in milliseconds.}

\item{binocular}{Specifies how a binocular data is treated. Options are \code{"cyclopean"} (binocular data is
converted to an average cyclopean image before saccades are extracted), \code{"monocular"} (saccades
are extracted independently for each eye), \code{"merge"} (default, saccades are extracted for each eye
independently but saccades from different eyes that temporally overlap are averaged into a binocular
saccade).}

\item{vote_threshold}{Value between 0..1 defining a vote threshold for a saccade.
By default, all but one method (\eqn{threshold = \frac{N-1}{N}}
where N is number of methods used) must agree for a sample to be considered for a saccade.
Threshold of 1 is applied if a single method is used.}

\item{minimal_duration_ms}{Minimal duration of a saccade in milliseconds. Shorter candidate saccades are discarded,}

\item{minimal_separation_ms}{Minimal time separation between saccades in milliseconds. Saccades that are
separated by a shorter interval of "not a saccade" votes, will be merged including that period.}

\item{return_votes}{Logical. Whether function should return extracted microsaccades (\code{FALSE}, default)
or votes per sample (\code{TRUE}).}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} with saccade properties (see **details**), if \code{return_votes = FALSE}.
Alternatively, it returns votes per sample (\code{return_votes = TRUE}). For a monocular processing (monocular
input, cyclopean or merged binocular data) it is a matrix with \code{nrow(x)} rows and \code{length(methods)}
 columns with 0/1 votes for each sample and method. For binocular processing, function returns a two element
 \code{list} with same matrices but per eye.
}
\description{
Extract saccades from samples using votes from selected methods. Each method votes whether
a given sample belongs to a saccade. Next, saccades are identified via a majority vote using the 
\code{vote_threshold} parameter, as well as a minimal duration and minimal temporal separation criteria.
Please note that units of the gaze samples must be in  \strong{degrees of visual angle}. The units are important
as some methods use specific (e.g., physiologically plausible) velocity and acceleration thresholds.
 
By default, ensemble includes methods proposed by Engbret & Kliegl (2003) (\code{"ek"}),
Otero-Millan et al. (\code{"om"}), and Nyström & Holmqvist (2010) (\code{"nh"}), 
see \emph{Implemented Methods} vignette. However, it can be extended
via custom methods, see \emph{Using Custom Methods} vignette.

By default, the function returns a table with identified saccades but can return a matrix with method's votes
per sample instead (\code{return_votes = TRUE}).
