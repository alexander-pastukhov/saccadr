\title{Extracts saccades from samples using votes from selected algorithms.}
\usage{
extract_saccades(
  x,
  y,
  sample_rate,
  velocity_time_window = 20,
  methods = list("ek", "om", "nh"),
  binocular = "merge",
  vote_threshold = (1 - length(methods))/length(methods) * 0.99,
  trial = NULL,
  options = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Horizontal coordinate, either a vector for monocular data or a two-column matrix for binocular data.}

\item{y}{Vertical coordinate, either a vector for monocular data or a two-column matrix for binocular data.}

\item{sample_rate}{Sampling rate in Hz.}

\item{methods}{A \emph{list} (not a vector!) with names of package methods (character) or external functions that
implement sample classification (see vignette on using custom methods). Package methods include
Engbret & Kliegl (2003) (\code{"ek"}), Otero-Millan et al. (\code{"om"}), Nystr√∂m and Holmqvist (2010) (\code{"nh"}).}

\item{binocular}{Specifies how a binocular data is treated. Options are \code{"cyclopean"} (binocular data is
converted to an average cyclopean image before saccades are extracted), \code{"monocular"} (saccades
are extracted independently for each eye), \code{"merge"} (default, saccades are extracted for each eye
independently but saccades from different eyes that temporally overlap are averaged into a binocular
saccade). Note that \code{binocular = "merge"} is overridden by \code{normalize = FALSE},
votes are left as they are per method and eye.}

\item{vote_threshold}{Value between 0..1 defining a vote threshold for a saccade. The default (\code{vote_threshold = 1})
means that _all_ methods must agree.}

\item{trial}{Optional vector with trial ID. If omitted, all samples are assumed to belong to a single trial.}

\item{options}{A named list with options for a specific method.}
