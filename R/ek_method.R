#' @description Extract microsaccades using an algorithm proposed by Engbert and
#' Kliegl (2003).
#'
#' @param x Gaze x coordinate, arbitrary units as threshold velocity is computed in units of standard deviation.
#' @param y Gaze x coordinate, arbitrary units as threshold velocity is computed in units of standard deviation.
#' @param sample_rate Sample rate of the recording in Hz.
#' @param trial Trial id. Trial borders are respected when computing velocity.
#' All samples are assumed to belong to the same trial, if \code{trial = NULL}.
#' @param velocity_time_window Time span in milliseconds relative to the sample
#' that is used  to compute the velocity. Defaults to 20 ms.
#' @param velocity_threshold Velocity threshold for microsaccade detection
#' in medians. Defaults to 6.
#' @param sd_fun Function used to compute standard deviation for velocities.
#' Defaults to \code{sd_via_median_estimator}, as per formula #2 in the paper.
#' Could be replaced with \code{mad}, \code{sd}, etc.
#' @param minimal_duration_ms Minimal duration of a microsaccade in milliseconds.
#' All shorter microsaccades are discarded. Defaults to 12 ms.
#' @param minimal_separation_ms A minimal required time gap between two microsaccades.
#' Two microsaccades that a separated by a smaller time gap are merged into a single
#' microsaccade. Defaults to 0 ms.
#'
#' @return logical vector marking samples that belong to a saccade.
